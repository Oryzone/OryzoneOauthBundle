==================

DON'T USE IT RIGHT NOW

It still needs:

- [ ] proper exception handling
- [ ] unit tests
- [ ] integration with composer
- [ ] way to generalize oauth1 and oauth2 to provide new services from runtime
- [ ] travis CI integration
- [ ] scrutinizer integration
- [ ] consider integration with symfony security
- [ ] consider integration with FOS user bundle
